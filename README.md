A server-client system which allows students to order food from the food court. 

This only works locally right now . If you want to test it with multiple computers you will have too edit the Socket object and put in the IP address of your computer.

Directions: 
Run the server. 
Run the FoodClient2.java file 
Send in the name of the resturaunt you want to be. 
Run the StudentClient11.java file 
Select what resturaunt you want to order from. Pick the resturaunt that you already have running. 
Send in your name 
select what items you want to order and add it to your cart. 
click the Send order button. 
On the resturaunt screen you should see your order pop up with your name in the drop down box. 
select your name in the drop down and click send.
you will then be notified on the student end.
